## The Application Shell ##
**Create a new work space and initial app project**	

- Make sure you aren't in the angular workspace already.

- Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name angular-tour-of-heroes, as shown here: ng new angular-tour-of-heroes

- The ng new command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app project. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.

It also creates the following workspace and starter project files:

- A new workspace, with a root folder named angular-tour-of-heroes.

- An initial skeleton app project, also called angular-tour-of-heroes (in the src subfolder).
- An end-to-end test project (in the e2e subfolder).


- Related configuration files. 

##Serve The Application##

Go to the workspace directory and launch the application.

- cd angular-tour-of-heroes

- ng serve --open

## **Angular Components** ##

The page you see is the application shell. The shell is controlled by an Angular component named AppComponent.

Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. They display data on the screen, listen for user input, and take action based on that input.

# Make Changes to the Application #

Open the project in your favorite Editor

You'll find the implementation of the shell AppComponent distributed over three files:


1. app.component.ts— the component class code, written in TypeScript.

2. app.component.html— the component template, written in HTML.

3. app.component.css— the component's private CSS styles.

**Change the application title**

Open the component class file (app.component.ts) and change the value of the title property to 'Tour of Heroes'.

Open the component template file (app.component.html) and delete the default template generated by the Angular CLI. Replace it with the following line of HTML.

**Add Application Styles**

Most apps strive for a consistent look across the application. The CLI generated an empty styles.css for this purpose. Put your application-wide styles there.

Open src/styles.css and add the code below to the file.

/* Application-wide Styles */

**h1 {
  color: #369;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 250%;
}

h2, h3 {
  color: #444;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-weight: lighter;
}

body {
  margin: 2em;
}

body, input[type="text"], button {
  color: #333;
  font-family: Cambria, Georgia;
}

/* everywhere else */
* {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

# Final Code Review #

Inside of src/app/app.component.ts you will add 

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})

export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Tour of Heroes';
}

Inside of src/app/app.component.html you will add 

<h1>{{title}}</h1>

Inside of src/styles.css (excerpt) you will add 

/* Application-wide Styles */

h1 {
  color: #369;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 250%;
}

h2, h3 {
  color: #444;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-weight: lighter;
}

body {
  margin: 2em;
}
body, input[type="text"], button {
  color: #333;
  font-family: Cambria, Georgia;
}

/* everywhere else */

*{
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
